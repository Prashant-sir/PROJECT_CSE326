                <p>Our energy is in proportion to the resistance it meets. We attempt nothing great but from a sense of the difficulties we have to encounter; we persevere in nothing great but from a pride in overcoming them.</p>

            <h2 style="text-align: center; font-size: 2.5rem; color: #1f3c73;">What is Renewable Energy?
                <br>Why Do We Need It?</h2>
            <p>Renewable energy is essential for ensuring a sustainable and cleaner future. Unlike fossil fuels, which are finite and contribute to climate change, renewable energy sources are abundant, cleaner, and can help power the world for generations. Hereâ€™s why we need renewable energy:</p>

            <div class="renewable-point">
                <h3>1. Environmental Protection</h3>
                <p>Renewable energy sources produce little to no greenhouse gas emissions, helping to mitigate climate change and reduce air pollution. They also preserve natural resources, unlike fossil fuels which are finite and cause environmental damage.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="renewable-point">
                <h3>2. Energy Independence and Security</h3>
                <p>Relying on local renewable energy sources reduces dependence on foreign energy imports. This increases energy security and resilience, while reducing vulnerability to geopolitical conflicts and supply disruptions.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="renewable-point">
                <h3>3. Economic Growth and Job Creation</h3>
                <p>The renewable energy sector is creating new jobs in research, development, manufacturing, and installation, offering long-term savings and economic growth, particularly in rural areas with abundant renewable resources.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="renewable-point">
                <h3>4. Sustainability for Future Generations</h3>
                <p>Unlike fossil fuels, which are running out, renewable energy sources like wind, solar, and water will last for as long as the Earth does, providing a reliable and sustainable energy solution for future generations.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="renewable-point">
                <h3>5. Health Benefits</h3>
                <p>Renewable energy reduces air pollution, improving public health by decreasing respiratory and cardiovascular diseases. It also reduces water usage, unlike fossil fuel plants that consume large amounts of water for cooling.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="renewable-point">
                <h3>6. Combatting Climate Change</h3>
                <p>By reducing carbon emissions, renewable energy plays a crucial role in addressing global warming. It helps countries meet international climate goals like the Paris Agreement and is essential for building a sustainable future.</p>
